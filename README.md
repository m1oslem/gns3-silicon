GNS3 UTM Image Silicon Mac 

GNS3 (Graphical Network Simulator-3) is a powerful network simulator used for testing and developing virtual network environments. But when running it on Apple Silicon devices (M1, M2, M3, M4), there are a few things to keep in mind:

-------------------------------------
Compatibility with Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3, M4)
1-Virtualization:
GNS3 relies on virtualization software such as VMware Fusion, UTM, and QEMU.
macOS on Apple Silicon only supports ARM-based virtual machines, which means running x86_64 virtual machines may be difficult or impossible.
2-GNS3 VM:
There is currently no official support for GNS3 VM on Apple Silicon because VMware and VirtualBox do not support running x86 systems on ARM.
UTM (which is based on QEMU) can be used, but it may be slow and unstable for some scenarios.
3- Virtualization Performance:
Dynamips-based network devices (such as Cisco IOS) can be run, but performance may be lower compared to x86 devices.
Advanced virtualization such as EVE-NG or Cisco CSR1000v may not work due to architecture incompatibility.

this file easy to use 
just download it - add to utm - run it 

can use gns3 for mac and config remote server to use it normally like 64x UTM
